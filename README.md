# cli-doc

A cli tool developed using GoLang to instantly look up documentation for libraries.

It might only save you two clicks but if you're looking at documentation 100 times a day then you're saving 200 clicks.

## How to use

Currently, it only supports few python libraries but the aim is to add all the common libraries as well as eventually add support for other languages. 

Use `doc` to get basic information. 
`doc help [command]` to get information. For example, `doc help numpy`.

We have also added `doc google [search query]`.

## How to install

Installation is very easy if you have go installed. Start by cloning the repository `git clone https://github.com/ParthS28/cli-doc`, open a terminal and navigate to the repository and type `go install`. As far as I know, this works perfectly on linux. We still need to check on other OS.

Become a contributor by checking the installation. 

## Contributing
The code underlying for this is very simple. This is a beginner friendly community. Do not feel overwhelmed and contribute.

## TODO
- [x] ability to use it without go installation
- [ ] adding support for other OS
