# cli-doc

A cli tool developed using GoLang to instantly look up documentation for libraries.

It might only save you two clicks but if you're looking at documentation 100 times a day then you're saving 200 clicks.

## How to use

Currently, it only supports few python libraries but the aim is to add all the common libraries as well as eventually add support for other languages. 

Use `doc` to get basic information. 
`doc help [command]` to get information. For example, `doc help numpy`.

We have also added `doc google [search query]`.

## Contributing
